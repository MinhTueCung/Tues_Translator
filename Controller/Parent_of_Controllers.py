# This class defines the skeleton of all "Controllers" (for the UI "X_View"), which are responsible for all the "functional"
# sides of the "Views". All the Controllers work under the reign of "main.py" (Main-App)
# The "View" is introduced to the Controller right at the moment of the ControllerÂ´s instantiation
# Every Controller must be able to communicate with the database, to get and to store informations
